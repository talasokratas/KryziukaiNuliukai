<p>This is the first android app I've made, it was an assigment for java class I had in coding school. I've had lot's of fun doing it, though I've learned how much java and android emulation is hungry for computer's resources. The steps I've taken can be seen in commits I've made. I would like to finsih it someday by adding multiple languages and I would like that the results to be saved in an external file</p>
<p>When playing on easy difficulty computer doesn't try at all because it makes only random moves. I think it's more fun to play it while actually trying to allow the computer to win. That's a neat little twist for this game :) </p>
<p> When playing on medium difficulty computer tries to use deffensive mode, trying to block player's winning sequence if two symbols matches any part of any winning combination, then if there's none computer tries offensive method, if he has two symbols mathcing any of winning combination, anything in between is a random move, also there's a slight chance computer will miss deffensive and offensive tactics and make a random move</p>
<p>When playing on hard difficulty computer firs checks it needs to block player's sequance, if not, then it checks if computer is close to any winning sequence, if not, then it tries to take center position, if center position is taken it will try to get any of corner positions, preventing player from winning easily or even winning at all </p>
